# üé≠ Facial Emotion Recognition using Face Landmarks

This project detects human facial emotions in real time using **MediaPipe Face Mesh** and **Random Forest Classifier**.  
By analyzing the geometric structure of the face through 3D landmarks, the system recognizes basic facial expressions such as **Happy**, **Sad**, and **Surprised**.  

It provides a lightweight yet effective approach for facial emotion recognition without the need for deep learning models, making it fast and efficient for live video processing.

## üß© Program Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation (`prepare_data.py`)
- Reads facial images from the `data/` directory, each subfolder representing an emotion.  
- Extracts **468 face landmarks √ó 3 coordinates (x, y, z)** using MediaPipe.  
- Saves the landmark features and emotion labels into `data.txt`.

### 2. Model Training (`train_model.py`)
- Loads `data.txt` and splits it into training and testing sets.  
- Trains a **Random Forest Classifier** to learn the relationship between facial landmarks and emotion categories.  
- Prints out accuracy and confusion matrix for evaluation.  
- Saves the trained model to `model` using pickle.

### 3. Real-Time Prediction (`test_model.py`)
- Opens webcam using OpenCV and captures each frame.  
- Extracts face landmarks in real time using MediaPipe.  
- Predicts the emotion class with the trained Random Forest model.  
- Displays the predicted emotion label (e.g., ‚ÄúHAPPY‚Äù) directly on the webcam feed.
